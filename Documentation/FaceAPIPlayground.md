Here you can explore age and gender prediction as well as face identification. You can do so by using web cam captures, local files on your hard drive or images from Bing Images. For people that have been added to the Face Identification Setup model it will show their names and age, and for unknown people it will show their gender and age. 

When using the web cam, hit the pause button to have it take a photo and show the results. Then hit the play button to resume the live feed.
