This is an example of an autonomous workflow for capturing photos when people approach a web camera and pose for a photo.

It uses the built-in face tracking functionality in Windows 10 to detect when people are nearby and applies a simple movement detection heuristic to determine when they are posing for a photo. In the example it also shows the age, gender and identification of all the people in each capture.
